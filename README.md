# Learningshala CMS - Frontend

Welcome to the frontend repository of the Learningshala CMS! (It was supposed to go live on Learningshala or Skollege)

## Overview

This repository contains the frontend code for the Courses and Universities CMS built for Learningshala, written in ReactJS & NextJS. It utilizes **Strapi**, a powerful headless CMS, to manage content efficiently. This frontend repository can help with scaling headless CMS with SEO optimised content and then later converted to full fledged product too as per the changing needs to provide personalised experience to end users.

## Background

We were the technology firm that built the entire CMS for Learningshala (Complete Design & Development). Unfortunately, the payment for our work was not completed by the co-founders, Devesh Singh and Aashish Singh. To promote transparency and contribute to the community, we decided to open source this project.

## Technology Stack

- **Next.js**: A React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind**: For styling components in a modular fashion
